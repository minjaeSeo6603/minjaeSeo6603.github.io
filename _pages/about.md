I am currently a Master of Arts in Public Policy candidate with a Certificate in Research Methods at the University of Chicago. I hold a B.A. in Statistics from the University of California, Berkeley, where I specialized in causal inference and machine learning methodologies applied to impact evaluation and policy analysis.

My research interests lie at the intersection of applied econometrics, computational social science, and data-driven policy evaluation, with a particular focus on double machine learning, high-dimensional forecasting, healthcare analytics, and advanced econometric approaches for identifying staggered treatment effects.

At the University of Chicago Department of Computer Science, I serve as a Graduate Teaching Assistant for Mathematical Foundations of Machine Learning, and I'm currently working as a research assistant for the Human Collaborative Interaction Lab.

I am actively seeking full-time opportunities for the summer of 2026, particularly as a data scientist, quantitative trader/analyst/researcher, machine learning researcher, and AI engineer, open to both public and private sectors globally.

Feel free to reach out to me at [minjaeseo@uchicago.edu](mailto:minjaeseo@uchicago.edu) or [ppori34@berkeley.edu](mailto:ppori34@berkeley.edu). I would love to connect!

In my free time, I enjoy weight training and challenging myself with intensive burnout sets at the gym.
