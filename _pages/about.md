I am currently an AI Labeling Analyst at [Handshake AI](https://joinhandshake.com/move-program/opportunities/math-stats-expert-%28bachelor-s%29-ai-trainer/), specializing in the preparation and annotation of high-quality data for machine learning applications. 

<!-- Starting September 2025, I will begin the Master of Science in Computational Analysis and Public Policy at the University of Chicago, a program I'll complete in May 2027. --> 

I earned my Bachelor's in Statistics from UC Berkeley, where I specialized in causal inference and machine learning methodologies applied to impact evaluation and policy analysis. My research interests encompass double machine learning, high-dimensional forecasting, healthcare analytics, and advanced econometric techniques for identifying staggered treatment effects.

I am actively seeking full-time opportunities starting immediately, particularly data scientist, quantitative trader/analyst/researcher, machine learning researcher, and AI engineer, open to both public and private sectors globally.

Feel free to reach out to me at [ppori34@berkeley.edu](mailto:ppori34@berkeley.edu), I would love to connect!

In my free time, I enjoy weight training and challenging myself with intensive burnout sets at the gym.
